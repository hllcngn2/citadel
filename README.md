# citadel: A terminal-based game (v0.2)

## second iteration

This time around we'll be focusing on
improving on the citadel's level design.

### progress:

- setting one's nick
- moving around and accross new maps
- still lacking any NPC interactions that were in v0.1

---

### usage:

```
make
./citadel
```

Your game is saved to the 'save' file,
which you can copy, or remove if you
want to start anew.

Currently the terminal window should be at
least h13 x w84 or h16 x w69.

Please feel welcome to open issues if
you encounter any problem with compiling
or running the game, have suggestions,
or requests. Note that this game is meant
to be multiplayer, not implemented yet,
for that matter it's far from being complete.
Thank you.

### controls:

**wasdqezx** : move\
**ESC** : save & quit

**first iteration (v0.1)**\
The first time around we went as far as to 
having Ratmen hanging around freely in the 
hallways of our Citadel before the messy 
code failed us. It was possible to talk with 
a couple of NPCs like Goldenfingers, the 
cursed man.
